Recreate the classic "do you like me, yes or no?" form.
* "Yes" will take you to the rest of the site (called just _story_ or something)
* "No" will open up a javascript alert that says "are you sure? Choosing this option _really_ messes with the gimmick here."
  * Test this on mobile please

# CSS
~~Use one of those ones that styles only the HTML elements and I can add additional things like grid for centering and stuff~~ >> Water.css

# JS
Should only need this to pop an alert on the "No" button and maybe on the final "Yes" button to animate some fun heart explosions or something.

# Quotes
~~Some quotes to intersperse between the page~~

~~"When I am with you, there is nowhere else I'd rather be. And I am a person who always wants to be somewhere else."~~

~~"You yourself are made up of atoms that rained down on to Earth billions of years ago. so when you meet someone and you swear that you have known them beforem that you have felt them before, know that there is no coincidence in that finally your cells are reunited, and at last, it feels like you are home."~~

~~"If i knew what safety looked like, I would have spent less time falling into arms that were not."~~

~~"I. a well-loved book.II. a cool, overcast day.III. a mug of coffee.IV. a warm blanket.V. you.- _the only things I need to feel free._"~~

* Images I've collected over time, so anything I've backed up online or have in Google photos
* Images she's put on Instagram or in her collections.

Here's how the story will progress

## Our Story
We met on tinder, i complimented your tattoos, we bonded over good charlotte. it was nice to know someone was real. i wasn't so sure you liked me but i trudged along anyway because i liked you and i wasn't going to give up.

We finally met, like for real, with an actual in person conversation, about a month after matching, on September 2nd, 2017. we didn't even have set plans but i was in my car anyway because i figured that was the best decision i guess. good thing it worked out, huh, and you didn't decide to cancel. because you almost did.

a month of you consuming my heart and all my thoughts ensued. After a playing a Front Royal house show on September 29th, we're driving home and reminesce about how people were making remarks to me like "hey who's your girlfriend?" Heh, well, I guess that was all we needed to finally make it official to ourselves (and the world) what this was we were doing.

We even emailed Dr. Magnotta about it on October 5th. What a wild ride.

A lot happened over the next few months (insert photo gallery). But let's really focus in on this one: (Sophie - just all sophie). - January 18th, 2018.

We even met The All-American Rejects! What! (pic).

You convinced me to get my first tattoo to the dismay of my own life-givers.

We moved into our first apartment together (photo gallery).

Spent some holidays together (photo gallery).

Went on a basically-free trip to Orlando together (gallery).

We've lived a lot of places together (photo of her behind the couch in my mom's basement, Sophie next to the tree, plus photos of the current apartment).

Then we got a second daughter! Because we thought that was going to be nothing but a good decision...

But now then we moved again - this time, somewhere a little more familiar.




### IDEA
add captions to the photos so they can be their own story. no need for multiple paragraphs.

12. we get another cat
13. we move to a new place in baltimore
14. now we're here
15. I don't want to try and summarize what the most major moments of our relationship are because even the one-off, smallest parts are the ones that leave the longest lasting impact whether we are consciously aware of it or not. How i can portray your dancing, or your mess making, or the way you lose all aspects of yourself when you look at sophie - how can I even begin to show those on this website? I can't. And I don't want to try because that would diminsh their real importance. Just don't stop being you because what you are is what I want.



Look, there's way too much in our 3 years than I can even begin to sum up, let alone put on a website that I'm trying to make when you're not looking while we're stuck quarantined together.

All I know if that I love you more than anything else in this whole entire world and I couldn't imagine life without you in it. I would not be whole and I would not be me without you. So I need you, and I want you, for always.



#### Things to add in somewhere
* worrying too much about not having enough pictures, but also realizing I probably don't have enough at all.
* Not wanting this to be too long I just want you to say yes and for this to look nice enough to convince you to agree.
* Look I thought about making this only a snapshot of our relationship from start to finish but realized that wasn't what it is meant to be. It's meant to also be the reasons I love you. Like the way you print out your puzzles every morning. Or do a new dance and ask if I like it.

## Will you marry me?
Yes?
No?
